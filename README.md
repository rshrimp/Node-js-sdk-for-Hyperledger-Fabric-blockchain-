## Asset transfer

This is   setting up 2 orgs with 2 peers each and Org3 with 1 peer.  All the orgs are joined through node js SDK client


It includes all the requirements  as listed below.
1.  Using Solo orderer
2.  Fabric CA for certificates.
3.  _TLS is enabled_
4. It includes a node.js app for doing all the setup activities:


    * create channels
    * join peers into channels
    * install chaincodes
    * instantiate chaincodes
    * invoke transactions
    * query the ledger



 Node js app is a client invoking all the above activities for all peers/orgs

## Transfer Consortium Setup
1. Org1 and Org2 with 2 peers each and Org3 with one peer.
2. Pre-created Member Service Providers (MSP) for authentication and identification
3. An Orderer using Kafka broker
4. _Testchannel_ â€“ this channel is public blockchain which all three orgs have read and write access to it.


#### Artifacts
* Crypto material has been generated and configured for all peers, the orderering node and CA containers.
* An Orderer genesis block (genesis.block) and channel configuration transaction (test.tx) has been pre generated.

## Testing

##### Terminal Window 1

`cd transferq3app (root folder)`

`./startServer.sh`



* This launches the required network.
* Installs the fabric-client and fabric-ca-client node modules
* And, starts the node app on PORT 4000

##### Terminal Window 2

In order for the following shell script to properly parse the JSON, you must install `jq`


`./setupNetwork.sh`

This scripts goes through and
  * enrolls org users,
  * creates channel,
  * join peers to channel,
  * installs chaincode,
  * instantiates chaincode,
  * invokes chaincode to create assets
  * invokes chaincode to transfer assets
  * and queries chaincode.
